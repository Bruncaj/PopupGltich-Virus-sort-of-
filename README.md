# PopupGltich-Virus-sort-of-
This popup is very glitchy. Full shutdown if you run it. Got a cmd killer and popup killer, but they can't delete fast enough. 
I am not responsible if your system dies, or is irretrievable.
Please don't do this on other computers.
This should be used for educational things.
Enjoy!
Make sure you use the branch of POPUP
Also make sure you add the file location of some of the vbs and bat files.
